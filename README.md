# Brakeman demo
 
This is a demo of how you can do static analysis at the commit level instead of the continuous integration server level. Please take a look at the gemfile to see the necessary dependencies. After you successfully run the simple blog application, take a look at overcommit.yml to see how to run specific tools and a specific time. More documentation can be found at overcommit's GitHub page (https://github.com/brigade/overcommit).
